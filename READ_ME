Welcome to my University of Minnesota Bootcamp code files!  

You can explore through my various weeks of work, including in-class project files along with some random things I've tried along the way. 
Hopefully this serves as a good place for my future self to both reference as well as to see how far I've come in my journey of "learning to code."
Somewhere in here is a file (bootCode/Portfolio/..) that contains my first attempt at a multi-page website with javascript.  That will be fun to look back on some day...
Anyhow, poke around. Maybe you'll come across something fun or interesting. 

Cheers!
Jake Handrick
